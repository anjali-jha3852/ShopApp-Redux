## 🔧 Development with React + Vite

This project uses **Vite** to provide a minimal setup with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) (uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) (uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh)

## 🛠 Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production apps, using **TypeScript with type-aware lint rules** is recommended.  
Check out the [React + TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate `typescript-eslint`.
